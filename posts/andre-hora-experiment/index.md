# Reproducing the Experiment of Andre Hora

I am trying to reproduce the experiment from the PhD thesis of Andre Hora.

## Outline of the Thesis

The thesis has four major parts:

1. **Benefits of Expert-based Rules** (Chapter 3) &mdash; are they worthwhile to be adopted given the cost to produce them?
2. **Supporting System-specific Conventions with History-Based Rules** (Chapter 4)
3. **Supporting Client Systems with History-based Rules** (Chapter 5)
4. **Impact of Software Evolution on Ecosystems** (Chapter 6)

I am interested in the third part.

## Terminology

- **Rules** &mdash; in this context, when we talk about rules, we mean...
- **Expert-based rules** &mdash; rules written manually by experts that have a deep understanding of the evolving system.
- **History-based rules** &mdash;
- **System-specific conventions** &mdash;
- **Client-specific convention** &mdash; 
- **Source code history** &mdash;

## Goal

In Chapter 5 of his thesis, Andre proposes an approach  to mine rules from source code history by focusing on better supporting client systems and by using data mining rather than predefined patterns.

Andre used data mining to extract evoliution rules from the commit history (of system or client?), evaluated them (how?), and compared results to the related work.

# How I Created an (almost) Free Personal Website Hosted by GitHub
In this post, I will document the process of creating my personal website that is hosted for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and available at [oleks.fr](http://oleks.fr). The code of this website is open source and available at [www.github.com/olekscode/oleks.fr](https://github.com/olekscode/oleks.fr).

**Disclaimer:** I am a PhD student in the field of software evolution and machine learning. My knowledge of web development is very limited and rather theoretical. Which means that many things that I did are probably wrong. I just needed a simple and cheap website. And in this post I document my experience "as is".

## Buying a Domain

Considering that I am a foreigner here, and the name Oleks &mdash; a short form of the Ukrainian-only name Oleksandr &mdash; is not very popular in France, it's not surprising that the domain oleks.fr was available for sale. It is a nice short domain name that is easy to type and not-so-hard to memorize.

At first, I tried to purchase oleks.fr using the [domain.com](https://domain.com) service. They accepted my registration and asked me to wait until they set up the domain. But after 48 hours of waiting, I gave up and decided to use another service. [domains.google.com](https://domains.google.com) provide a clean and user-friendly UI for exploring available domain names and buying one, but in France it can only be used for business and commercial reasons.

Finally, for some 5.99â‚¬, I have purchased oleks.fr at [https://www.ovh.com/fr/domaines/](https://www.ovh.com/fr/domaines/). And my order was ready in 2 minutes! Take that [domain.com](https://domain.com)! :P
